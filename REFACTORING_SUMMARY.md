# Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The monolithic `page.tsx` file has been successfully refactored into a modular, maintainable codebase following the principle of single responsibility.

## New Structure

### üìÅ Components (`src/components/`)
- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`)
  - `ray-burst.tsx` - Animated ray burst visual element
  - `reveal.tsx` - Intersection observer-based reveal animation
  - `index.ts` - Export barrel

- **Section Components** (`src/components/sections/`)
  - `header.tsx` - Navigation and branding
  - `hero.tsx` - Main landing section with stats
  - `mission.tsx` - Mission statement and values
  - `approach.tsx` - Interactive focus areas
  - `daily-life.tsx` - Daily rhythms showcase
  - `founder-story.tsx` - Founder's background story
  - `impact-stories.tsx` - Interactive success stories
  - `support.tsx` - Partnership and support section
  - `footer.tsx` - Site footer with links
  - `index.ts` - Export barrel

### üìÅ Data (`src/data/`)
- `focus-areas.ts` - Care approach focus areas
- `daily-rhythms.ts` - Daily schedule information
- `impact-stories.ts` - Success stories data
- `values.ts` - Core values
- `stats.ts` - Statistics data
- `navigation.ts` - Navigation links
- `index.ts` - Export barrel

### üìÅ Types (`src/types/`)
- `index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### üìÅ Main App (`src/app/`)
- `page.tsx` - Clean, minimal main page component (reduced from 760 to ~40 lines)

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different pages
4. **Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
6. **Performance**: Better code splitting and lazy loading opportunities
7. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## File Size Reduction
- **Before**: 1 monolithic file (760 lines)
- **After**: 20+ focused files (average ~50-100 lines each)

## Import Structure
All components and data are accessible through clean barrel exports:
```typescript
import { Header, Hero, Mission } from "@/components";
import { focusAreas, stats } from "@/data";
import type { FocusArea } from "@/types";
```

The codebase now follows modern React/Next.js best practices with clear separation of concerns and excellent maintainability.
